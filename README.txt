First, enter the project directory and run:
  "mkdir tic_out && mkdir car_quality_out"

Make sure that the scipy, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn modules are installed
in python

Now, to generate all the numbers and figures used in the assignment, run:
  "python tobin.py car_quality"
  "python tobin.py tic"

In the __main__ definition of "tobin.py", specific experiments can be commented
out to speed up the program
